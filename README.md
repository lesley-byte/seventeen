# seventeen  
Python script to quickly give the year an individual turned 17. no buttons to click.  just don't use backspace or delete when entering the year.  If you do then you will just need to restart the program...not a big deal.
You need to have python and the module PySimpleGUI installed on your computer as well as a python IDE.
